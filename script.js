  {
    question: "You need 1/4 cup of sugar and 1/3 cup of flour. How much do you have in total?",
    answer: "7/12",
    tip: "Remember, you need a common denominator to add fractions. For 1/4 and 1/3, the least common denominator is 12.",
    explanation: "To add fractions with different denominators, find the least common denominator (LCD). For 1/4 and 1/3, the LCD is 12, so convert both fractions to have this denominator before adding."
  },

  // Subtraction Problems
  {
    question: "The recipe needs 2/5 cup of oil, but you only have 1/3. How much more do you need?",
    answer: "1/15",
    tip: "To subtract fractions, find a common denominator first. For 2/5 and 1/3, the least common denominator is 15.",
    explanation: "To subtract fractions with different denominators, first find the LCD. For 2/5 and 1/3, the LCD is 15, so convert both fractions to have this denominator before subtracting."

  {
    question: "You need 1/2 cup of milk and 1/4 cup of cream. How much do you need in total?",
    answer: "3/4",
    tip: "Find a common denominator to add these fractions. The least common denominator for 1/2 and 1/4 is 4.",
    explanation: "Convert both fractions to have a denominator of 4, then add the numerators together."
  },

  // Subtraction Problems
  {
    question: "You added 3/8 cup of milk, but the recipe calls for 1/2 cup. How much more do you need to add?",
    answer: "1/8",
    tip: "Convert 1/2 into an equivalent fraction with denominator 8: 1/2 = 4/8.",
    explanation: "When subtracting fractions, make sure both fractions have the same denominator. Convert 1/2 to 4/8, then subtract 3/8 from 4/8."

  {
    question: "You need 3/4 cup of chocolate chips and 2/5 cup of walnuts. How much do you need in total?",
    answer: "23/20",
    tip: "To add these fractions, find the least common denominator. For 3/4 and 2/5, the least common denominator is 20.",
    explanation: "Convert both fractions to have a denominator of 20, then add the numerators together."
  },

  // Subtraction Problems
  {
    question: "You need 7/10 cup of cream, but you only have 3/5. How much more do you need?",
    answer: "1/10",
    tip: "Convert 3/5 to 6/10 before subtracting it from 7/10.",
    explanation: "Convert both fractions to the same denominator and subtract them to find how much more cream is needed."
  },

  // Addition Problems
  {
    question: "You need 5/6 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of flour. How much do you need in total?",
    answer: "8/6",
    tip: "Find a common denominator for 5/6 and 1/2. The least common denominator is 6.",
    explanation: "Convert 1/2 to 3/6 and then add 5/6 and 3/6 to get the total."
